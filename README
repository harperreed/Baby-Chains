h2. Background   

My buddy dylan (@detour1999) and his lovely wife had a child. They took their sweet time naming it. They had awesome ideas - but i thought i would help out by creating a markov chain baby name generator.

Markov chains ALWAYS make things better. 

The code is based on code from a post here: 
http://codeismightier.com/2008/10/generating-domain-names/
(it is a dead link - so http://codeismightier.com/?s=markov)

Filename: markov_chain.py
Copyright: Yongqian Li
License: This code is released under GPLv3

h2. Information  : 
--------------
Basically this looks through a list of names, creates a model based on which letters are frequently near one another and outputs awesomeness. 

You can find more info here:

Note: it is used by spammers. wouldn't it be awesome to have a kid named like a spam email!

Plans : 
-------

I want to make it so it doesn't have a hard stop at n chars. This is the initial version - so when i grep through my IRC bot source i should be able to release a better version. 


Usage  : 
--------

python baby_chains.py <initial> <length>
